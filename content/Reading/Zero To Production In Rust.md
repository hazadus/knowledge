> [!abstract]
> _Zero To Production_ is the ideal starting point for your journey as a Rust backend developer. You will learn by doing: you will build a fully functional email newsletter API, starting from scratch.
>
You'll learn how to:
>
>- Navigate and leverage Rust's crates ecosystem
>- Structure your application to make it modular and extensible
>- Write tests, from single units to full-blown integration tests
>- Enforce your domain invariants using Rust's type system
>- Authenticate and authorize users of your API
>- Implement a robust error handling strategy
>- Observe the state of your application using structured logs
>- Set up an extensive continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline for your Rust projects
>
All code comes attached to the book, tests included.

Load balancing relies on a strong assumption: no matter which backend is used to serve an incoming request, the outcome will be the same.

That‚Äôs why load balancing works: all backends are talking to the same database to query and manipulate the same **state**.

Think of a database as a single gigantic global variable. Continuously accessed and mutated by all replicas of our application.
