**Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change, Second Edition â€“ Kent Beck, 2004**

- âœ…Â In software development, "perfect" is a verb, not an adjective. There is no perfect process. There is no perfect design. There are no perfect stories. You can, however, perfect your process, your design, and your stories.

- âœ…Â Projects don't go faster by accepting lower quality. They don't go slower by demanding higher quality. Pushing quality higher often results in faster delivery; while lowering quality standards often results in later, less predictable delivery.

- âœ…Â Keep effective teams together. There is a tendency in large organizations to abstract people to things, plug-compatible programming units. Value in software is created not just by what people know and do but also by their relationships and what they accomplish together.

- As a young software engineer, I learned three variables by which to manage projects: speed, quality, and price. The sponsor gets to fix two of these variables and the team gets to estimate the third. If the plan is unacceptable, the negotiating starts.

- This model doesn't work well in practice. Time and costs are generally set outside the project. That leaves quality as the only variable you can manipulate. âœ…Â **Lowering the quality of your work doesn't eliminate work, it just shifts it later so delays are not clearly your responsibility. You can create the illusion of progress this way, but you pay in reduced satisfaction and damaged relationships. Satisfaction comes from doing quality work.**
