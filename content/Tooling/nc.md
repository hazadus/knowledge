**netcat** (often abbreviated to **nc**) is a computer networking utility for reading from and writing to network connections using [TCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol "Transmission Control Protocol") or [UDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol "User Datagram Protocol"). The [command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_(computing) "Command (computing)") is designed to be a dependable [back-end](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_and_back_ends "Front and back ends") that can be used directly or easily driven by other programs and scripts. At the same time, it is a feature-rich network debugging and investigation tool, since it can produce almost any kind of connection its user could need and has a number of built-in capabilities.

It is able to perform [port scanning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_scanner "Port scanner"), [file transferring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_transfer "File transfer") and port listening.

- Built-in port-scanning capabilities, with randomization
- Built-in loose source-routing capability
- Can read command line arguments from standard input
- Slow-send mode, one line every N seconds
