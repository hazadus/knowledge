In software engineering, **dependency injection** is a programming technique in which an object or function receives other objects or functions that it requires, as opposed to creating them internally.

Dependency injection aims to separate the concerns of constructing objects and using them, leading to loosely coupled programs. The pattern ensures that an object or function which wants to use a given service should not have to know how to construct those services. Instead, the receiving 'client' (object or function) is provided with its dependencies by external code (an 'injector'), which it is not aware of. Dependency injection makes implicit dependencies explicit.

Dependency injection is often used to keep code in-line with the [[Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)]].
