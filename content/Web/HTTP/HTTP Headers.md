> **HTTP headers**¬†let the client and the server pass additional information with an HTTP request or response. An HTTP header consists of its case-insensitive name followed by a colon (`:`), then by its value.¬†[Whitespace](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Whitespace)¬†before the value is ignored.

Headers can be grouped according to their contexts:

- [Request headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Request_header): Contain more information about the resource to be fetched, or about the client requesting the resource.
- [Response headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Response_header): Hold additional information about the response, like its location or about the server providing it.
- [Representation headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Representation_header): Contain information about the body of the resource, like its¬†[MIME type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types), or encoding/compression applied.
- [Payload headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Payload_header): Contain representation-independent information about payload data, including content length and the encoding used for transport.
